                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-6">Developed a crypto options trading algorithm (Jan -
                    Jul 2023)</h2>
                <div class="text-gray-300">
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I wanted to build an algorithm for prediction markets. I started with cricket but quickly
                        shifted to crypto since time arbitrage and fixing weren't prevalent in small-sized crypto
                        options and on the exchange. The primary goal was to develop an algorithm that could trade
                        better than humans. When we began, I had no idea how Python worked, but early ChatGPT assistance
                        was invaluable.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Significant challenges at the start:</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                        <li>Options time duration was 20 minutes, and they were binary.</li>
                        <li>Research in this space, especially in crypto, was negligible, providing no solid foundation
                            to begin.</li>
                        <li>High unpredictability of the crypto market – pretty obvious challenge.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mb-6">
                        I dove in headfirst, spending significant time analyzing data and talking to traders. True
                        realization began when I started manually reading the data. After working with it for so long, I
                        gained a rough understanding of what the price of an option should be, and when it didn't match,
                        I looked for reasons. It was a hellish three months of figuring things out, especially with no
                        mentorship on how to build something like this or if it was even possible. But with strong
                        encouragement from mentors to just keep trying, I managed to create the algorithm. It wasn't
                        perfect, but it performed exceptionally well under certain conditions.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Good conditions for the algorithm:</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                        <li>When the market was highly unpredictable but not in a pump-and-dump cycle</li>
                        <li>When the market wasn't racing up or down</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mb-6">
                        The algorithm was based on random motion, which I later realized was a foundation of the
                        Black-Scholes equation too. I applied a 1D analogy instead of a 2D one. Sometimes, it worked so
                        well that we made 10x returns in an hour from our base capital.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Why didn't I continue?</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>Crypto volumes in the real market dried up: When this happens, the market stays stable for
                            long periods, and theta decay becomes the primary way to make money. I had no idea what
                            theta was at that time.</li>
                        <li>The exchange we were working with was reconsidering allowing algorithms due to legal
                            considerations.</li>
                        <li>A minor factor was the uncertainty surrounding government taxation on high-frequency trading
                            (HFT) in these spaces.</li>

                    strategies at a hedge fund (Aug 2023 - Jan 2024)</h2>

                    <p>
                        At the hedge fund, I wasn't as satisfied with my performance as I usually am. Building a massive
                        simulation capable of testing 1 million different trading strategies with limited GPU usage and
                        time was a significant achievement. Each iteration improved, but I never felt it was good enough
                        for the time I spent on it. However, two positive things came out of the experience: I regained
                        trust in my mathematical skills, and I realized that more than money, what really matters to me
                        is making an impact and solving people's problems.
